# GPToggle: Multi-Provider AI Model Wrapper

GPToggle is a comprehensive wrapper for multiple AI providers including OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Meta's Llama, Perplexity, and xAI Grok. It simplifies working with various AI APIs by providing automatic model selection, unified interface, and response comparison.

## Latest Version: 2.0.0 - Model-Agnostic Architecture (Beta)

**New in 2.0.0 (Beta):**
- **Dynamic Model Registry**: Register models at runtime without code changes
- **Rich Model Metadata**: Detailed capability descriptions for intelligent selection
- **Capability-Based Selection**: Choose models based on specific requirements
- **Provider-Agnostic Interface**: Unified API across different AI providers
- **Custom Provider Handlers**: Register handlers for any AI provider
- **Unified Scoring System**: Sophisticated selection algorithm with explanations

Read the [MODEL_REGISTRY.md](MODEL_REGISTRY.md) documentation for details on the new approach.

**New in 1.0.4:**
- Added support for Meta's Llama API (llama-3-8b-instruct, llama-3-70b-instruct, llama-3-vision)
- Added support for Perplexity API (llama-3.1-sonar models with up-to-date web information)
- Updated provider priority ranking to include new providers
- Created dedicated example files for Llama and Perplexity integrations
- Task-specific recommendations now include the new providers

**New in 1.0.3:**
- Task-specific model recommendations for multi-faceted prompts
- Component-specific model suggestions embedded in responses
- Follow-up task recommendations based on detected prompt components
- Enhanced model selection rationale with detailed task analysis
- 6 task categories with provider-specific model strengths

## Core Features

### ðŸ“Š Advanced Task Analysis
- **Multi-Task Detection**: Identifies different task types within a single prompt
- **Component-Specific Recommendations**: Suggests optimal models for each part of complex requests
- **Follow-up Task Suggestions**: Recommends models for likely next steps in your workflow

### ðŸ”§ Multiple Implementation Options
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Browser and Node.js compatible with enhanced features
- **Python Package**: Full-featured package with provider integrations
- **Standalone Files**: Self-contained implementations requiring no installation
- **Model-Agnostic Architecture**: Dynamic model registry with rich metadata (v2.0+)

### ðŸš€ Developer-Friendly
- **Simple API**: Easy-to-use interface for all skill levels
- **Rich Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable provider priorities and model mappings
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type definitions for model metadata and capabilities
